The [MicroPython command line tool](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html) works about the best for copying code over to the rp2040, the [fs subcommands](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html#mpremote-command-fs) are what we need for copying code.

To connect your Badger2040W to a network you will need to edit the WIFI_CONFIG.py in the root folder - more details [on the Pimoroni page](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-badger-2040#customising-the-badgeros-examples).
